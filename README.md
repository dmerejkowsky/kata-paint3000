# Paint3000 - a refactoring exercise

## Instructions

First, make sure you can run the tests. This will involve creating a virtualenv and installing `pytest` in it.

Second, try and understand what the `Paint` class does and how it works.

Then, try to use the Command/Query separation and the Single Responsibility principles to refactor the code.

Notes:

* You *must not* change the public API of the `Paint` class nor the `./test_paint.py` file
* You can introduce as many classes and as many modules you want.

Have fun :)
